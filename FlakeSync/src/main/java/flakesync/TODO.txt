1.
-Use NonDex code to run surefire test
-Adding maven dependencies
       -Look in imports and pom.xml
       -Google the class and figure out which .jar,
       -usually .jar files will be on maven central
2. Make sure it works on other repositories, see if
    -If mvn surefire:test fails, it is a me problem
    -If it works consistently --> get fail data

3. Next step: Run one test at a time
    -Make a method that only runs one test
        -API-like design
    -Get result of that test, whether passed or failed
    -Add to NonDex config "rewriting the xml"
    TESTING:
    -Write your own input.csv file & write a bash script that can iterate through and run each test using the plugin
        - USE THIS FOR EASE "cut -d, -f1 all_input.csv | sort -u | wc -l"
        - Choose 1 test per project, maybe 1 per module

        -flaxsearch/luwak: TestPartitionMatcher.testParallelSlowLog
        -fluent/fluent-logger:  Source option 6 is no longer supported. Use 7 or later.
                                Target option 6 is no longer supported. Use 7 or later.
        -^^^Same error for qos-ch/logback
        -


4. Next step: Run test but with delays like delay injection
    -Run test for concurrent methods
          -Add agent as part of the argline
            -Agent modifies the pom.xml and adds the dependencies
          -Look for agent in the bash script
